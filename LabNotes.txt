to get gemma working for 1st half, follow elastic net script

in addition to genotype file look for snp annotation file

The idea is to pull out SNPs within on megabase of each gene (first part of for loop, goes through gene list)
Once for loop works, it will be fine

Top part: get info to see where gene is

bim file: SNP annotation (check elastic net script) -- 
fam file: list of individual IDs/sex/relationship (check elastic net) -- list of sample IDs

Get one gene working!

dim names -- dimension names (# rows, # cols)

Dr. Wheeler will take a look, get file paths
Paper: differences in populations, applied to a disease. Show GWAS in Europeans, in Africans not there

Figure 2: how did they get these values? ISC -- training sample
Ran GWAS on ISC, then (didn't have genome wide significance) so they looked deeper
Case-control so odds ratio for all SNPs
Calculate score for second cohort with SNPs at each threshold
R^2 --> variance explained
Test five diff thresholds 
Still signal even at P of 0.5
Other diseases -- negative control
Put on slide all abbreviations! 
Overlapping architecture between bipolar/schizo
MGS-AA is lower (different linkage patterns)
MGS-EA
O'Donovan
Could make a table next to the slide with populations...could include info about which country
MGS = largest signal

Trying to only test independent signals rather than redundancy 
Even with pruning they see significant ability to
Score higher in cases than controls

Vm Va --> corner of slide to remind self what they are!
If you knew the causative SNPs, that would explain a better proportion of variance than just things linked
Va --> total additive genetic variance
Vm --> marker variance
SNPs linked to other SNPs...if you genotype one that's not functional SNP, any effect size will be smaller
Vm should be lower than Va

Figure 3
a -- real data
b -- polygenic models
--> GRR: genotypic relative risk
(all small...less than 1.1 effect size)
c -- assuming 10 to 100 causal alleles

Can re-use some images from Wheeler's
--Schizophrenia is like tiny boxes on the hillside

Figure 4
Simulating the causal alleles with a normal distribution
Haven't measured rare stuff in observed
In simulation of SNPs with causal alleles 0-100%, matches more with observed

In families, it could be a single large effect that causes something
Parents/children to get at rare things

1.3rd of heritability in schizophrenia explained by common variance
Modeling things this way shows that there is something there, but can only explain ~3% of the variance 

Look at what has been done SINCE paper (2009)

End with what they're at now/future directions/how the paper predicted future directions/how have things changed since 2009?
Comment on where are authors???
They are all at the end

GWAS won't tell all answers!

NOTE: Missed meeting
Rough outline for running chromosomes:
nohup taskset -c [core #] Rscript bslmm_for_emma.r [chromsome] YRI

Main thing: generate plots of data
Once all files merged
Two params of interest: pve50 
-->pve is the heritability estimate (how heritable is expression?)
-->the 50 is the median
---->Gives an estimate each time it goes through
-->use error bars for confidence intervals
PVE: percent variance explained (by SNPs or other input/whatever you're modeling...in this case, want SNPs to model gene expression)
----> "Percent 
PGE50: sparse component of PVE
E.g. if PVE is 0.5 (i.e. 50%) and PGE is 0.75 (i.e. 75%), then it's 75% of %50 for the sparse architecture. Rest of 50% is polygenic model. 

Rmarkdown (tutorial posted in slack)
-->ggplot2 library

ngamma50 --> number of SNPs in each predictive model
---> model throws correlated things out

HISTOGRAM for ngamma50 
--> show distribution

PVE50 vs. position (upward curve with error bars)

See slack for further instructions

3 histograms: one for each of the PVE50, PVE50, NGamma50

Explain BSLMM -- look at reference
Summarize in short paragraph 
Bulk: the methods
----> software
----> parameters
----> data
----> results: what we're working on now
----> discussion: next steps
--------> Possibly run another population if there's time!

Other population: not LWK, any other one!

Longterm goal: paper with results from HapMap populations
----> Aly and Natalie -- look at their paper
